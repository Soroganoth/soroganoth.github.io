            A look at the security of cross tenant applications in Azure AD The goal of this article is to dig deeper into some poorly document security aspects of Azure Active Directory Applications, particularly regarding multi tenant applications.
This is not a comprehensive guide about application and service principal security, but an overview of some interesting security properties which I find non-obvious and interesting.
If you are not familiar with the basic concepts of Applications and Service principals in Azure AD, I suggest starting with the documentation.
